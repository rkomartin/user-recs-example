# User-based Recommendation Reference Design

This reference design demonstrates how to use the [Veritable API](https://dev.priorknowledge.com) to generate recommendations based on the ratings that a user has given other items.

See [this page](FIXME) on the [Veritable developer docs](https://dev.priorknowledge.com/docs) for a more complete introduction and discussion of recommendation systems, and the architecture and implementation of this example.
